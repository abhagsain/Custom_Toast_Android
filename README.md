# Custom_Toast_Android
This repo contains an example of Custom Toast.

1. Create a seperate xml file for your toast and design the layout of your toast there.
2. This step is optional: Create another xml file which contains the background gradient of your toast, but you can also use simple colors for the toast background, a gradient is not necessary.
3. Create a view, LayoutInflater and a Toast class object.

Example:
